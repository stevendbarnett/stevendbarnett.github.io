I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Statistics at Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University. My research interests include Gaussian process
surrogate modeling, computer experiments, Bayesian statistics, and statistical
computing. My recent focus has been on developing deep Gaussian processes as
surrogate models in computer model calibration where the response variable is
discrete and the surface is extremely non-stationary. During my graduate degree I
have been advised by [Bobby Gramacy](https://bobby.gramacy.com). I plan to defend my
dissertation in May 2025.

In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my wife and two kids. We love being
outside, in particular going hiking and cycling. I am an avid sports and love to play
just about any sport (e.g. tennis, volleyball, basketball, pickleball). I love to
travel within the United States and abroad. Recent conferences have brought me to
Banff, Canada and Trieste, Italy.
